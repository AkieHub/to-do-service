To Captures quick ideas, check tasks off your To-Do list, and much more.  One of the fundamental features for any productivity tool is a To-Do list. With the To-Do Tracker, you can create and share notes and lists.   To-do Tracker can help you get, and stay, on top of important projects and piles of tasks or decisions. For instance, imagine you're heading a team that's working on a project. There are so many tasks to do, and so many people doing them, that staying on top of it all seems overwhelming.
